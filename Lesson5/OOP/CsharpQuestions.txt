1. Write the steps and code for a "Hello World" C# WinForm application
	To write the code for your application
	Double-click the button to add an event handler for the Button1 Click event. 
	The Code Editor will open with the insertion point placed within the event handler.
	// C#
	MessageBox.Show("Hello, World!");

2. Write steps to test your application
	Press F5 to run the application.
	When your application is running, click the button and verify that "Hello, World!"
	is shown. Close the Windows Form to return to Visual Studio.

4. What is a variable (var) give a real world example of a variable?	A variable is a value that can change. Bank account money.
5. Who is the lead architect of C#?
	Anders Hejlsberg.

6. What are C# data types and name three common data types
	Data types are used everywhere in a programming language like C#. 
	Because it's a strongly typed language, you are required to inform
	the compiler about which data types you wish to use every time you
	declare a variable, as you will see in the chapter about variables. 
	In this chapter we will take a look at some of the most used data types 
	and how they work. 
	bool is one of the simplest data types. It can contain only 2 values - false or true. 
	The bool type is important to
	understand when using logical operators like the if statement. 

	int is short for integer, a data type for storing numbers without decimals. 
	When working with numbers, int is the most commonly used data type. 
	Integers have several data types within C#, depending on the size of the 
	number they are supposed to store. 

	string is used for storing text, that is, 
	a number of chars. In C#, strings are immutable, 
	which means that strings are never changed after 
	they have been created. When using methods which 
	changes a string, the actual string is not changed - 
	a new string is returned instead. 
	char is used for storing a single character. 

	float is one of the data types used to store numbers which 
	may or may not contain decimals.

7. What are the types of comment in C#?  
	There are 3 types of comments in C#.
	Single line (//)
	Multi (/* */)
	Page/XML Comments (///).

8. What are the basic concepts of object oriented programming?  
	It is necessary to understand some of the concepts used extensively in object oriented programming.
	These include:
	Objects
	Classes
	Data abstraction and encapsulation
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism
	Dynamic Binding
	Message passing.

9. What is the code to open a second form?
	private void button_Click(Object sender, EventArgs e)
	{
		// create a new instance of the Form2 class
		Form2 myForm = new Form2();
	
		// show the setting form
		myForm.Show();
	}

10. Write the steps to set which of the forms appear first?
	In Program.cs
	Application.Run(new Form1())

11. What is IO in System.IO;?
	Input Output

12. What class is used to read a file in C#?
	StreamReader class

13. Name some usages of the "this" keyword in C#?
	To qualify members hidden by similar name
	To have an object pass itself as a parameter to other methods
	To have an object return itself from a method
	To declare indexers
	To declare extension methods
	To pass parameters between constructors
	To internally reassign value type (struct) value.
	To invoke an extension method on the current instance
	To cast itself to another type
	To chain constructors defined in the same class

14. On this sheet, what line number is the word set?
	line number 19

15.  Write a string array game, with the following items "Arya", "Tyrion", "Yara", "Daenerys", "Ramsay",
	"Joffrey" Write code to loop through the array and create a pop-up messsage box, to display each one of the names / items.
            string[] game = { "Arya", "Tyrion", "Yara", "Daenerys", "Ramsay", "Joffrey" };

            for (int i = 0; i < game.Length; i++)
            {
                MessageBox.Show(game[i].ToString());
            }

            foreach (var person in game)
            {
                MessageBox.Show(person);
            }

16. Why is C# called "C sharp"?
	The name "C sharp" was inspired from musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note should be made a half-step higher in pitch.	This is similar to the language name of C++, where "++" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four "+" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++.

17.  How many hours does it take to learn C#?		10,000 hours
18.  Create a comboBox with the following list of names "Arya", "Tyrion", "Yara", "Daenerys" write the
		code that displays a pop-up with either "You picked Tyrion!" else "I'm not sure who you picked."
19. Why was C# developed?
